# Dataquest-Prison-Break_Project
It's about prison breaks! 
In this project, we'll do the following: 
1) Obtain real data from the Internet and prepare it for analysis Analyze the data using Python Author our first portfolio project in Jupyter Notebook, to share code and communicate results 
2) Specifically, we'll answer the following questions: 
	a) In which year did the most attempts at breaking out of prison with a helicopter occur? 
	b) In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison escapes occur? 
	
What I do in this project:

Use real data from the open source on the Internet and clean it for analysis
Analyze the data using Python
This project mainly answers these two questions:

1 - In which year were there the most attempts to escape out of prison using a helicopter?

2 - Which countries have the highest number of attempted jail escapes via helicopter?

Results

1- With a total of three attempts each, the years 1986, 2001, 2007, and 2009 have the most helicopter jail escape attempts.

2 - France has far and away the most attempted helicopter jail escapes.
